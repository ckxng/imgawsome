=========

AWS-backed image upload service

Status
------

This project is ON-HOLD and NON-FUNCTIONAL.

While I do have interest in working on this project, it is not a priority at this time.

At the time this project went ON-HOLD, it had the following features:
- generate time-limited AWS signatures
- load an angular webapp, with limited ability to view a hard-coded list of images

This software is missing key functionality.

Architecture
------------

1. *Elastic Beanstalk* - Node.js Application Hosting
2. *DynamoDB* - User database
3. *S3* - Image storage

Authors
-------

This is a personal, fun-project for Ian and Cameron to experiment with 
JavaScript, HTML5, Node.js, and AWS.
